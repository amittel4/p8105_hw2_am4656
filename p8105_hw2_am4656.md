# Problem 1

*Importing “NYC_Transit_and_Subway_Entrance_and_Exit_Data.csv” from a
relative file path to my working directory, cleaning column names, and
then selecting for only “line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance” by selecting for the range of columns incoprorating those
variables and removing unwanted variables. Then, converting the entry
variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable using “ifelse”
and then removing the original entry variable (i.e. the character
version, leaving the logical version).*
